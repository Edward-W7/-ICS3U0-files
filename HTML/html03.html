    <h4>Japanese facts</h4>
    <p>
        Japan is one of the largest East Asian countries, with a population of 125.7 million and a surface area of 377,973
        <abbr title="Kilometers">km</abbr><sup>2</sup>. Its most spoken language is Japanese.
        <br /> Japanese has many interesting facts, including the fact that many of its phrases are actually palindromes.
        <br />
        "かるいきびんなこねこなんびきいるか," which means "How many light clever cats are there?" is the same backwards:
        <!-- Use <bdo> for bidirectional text -->
        <bdo dir="rtl">"かるいきびんなこねこなんびきいるか"</bdo>
        <br />
        Japan also has many national attractions, including Mount Fuji and the Imperial Palace.

        I want to visit Japan because of the food, and also because it has a vibrant and diverse culture. Its culture
        includes things like traditional
